The Pavilion is an open-space designed for public using. It adopted the WikiHouse building system with WREN. The house is primarily designed for Beijing No.4 HIgh School as an open space for encouraging the communication between school staff and students. It's also suitable for other public using and entertaining purpose. The house can be largely self-assembled, and costs around ¥15000-20000 to produce.
